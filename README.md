# RPS-test
Simple implementation of "rock paper scissors". No GUI yet
but will be added alter.

Update (10/24/22):
Finished UI and button functionality. Should now be presented with
a barebones page with 3 RPS buttons, txt, and results. Had a small
bump forgetting to put the script tag at the bottom which caused the
script to run before the page fully loaded.
